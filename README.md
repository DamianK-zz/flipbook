flipbook (soon to be replaced)
==============================

NOTE: This repo is old. I'm preparing a new one with support for different PHP (and other languages too) frameworks and an updated php version support.

A simple flipbook based on William Grauvogel's jquery plugin, modified to fit my needs.
This flipbook shows some JPG images in each page, or it can contain simple HTML.
