flipbook
========

NOTE: I have not updated this repo in some time. I'm planning creating some libraries for using this on the main frameworks. I'll keep you updated.

A simple flipbook based on William Grauvogel's jquery plugin, modified to fit my needs.
This flipbook shows some JPG images in each page, or it can contain simple HTML.
