flipbook
========
NOTE: this has been not mantained for a long time, most probably it requires update. Please send me a message if you need help implementing with it.

A simple flipbook based on William Grauvogel's jquery plugin, modified to fit my needs.
This flipbook shows some JPG images in each page, or it can contain simple HTML.
It is very useful for creating small books demos, catalogs, etc
